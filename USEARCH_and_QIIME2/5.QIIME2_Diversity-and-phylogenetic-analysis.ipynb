For example, if you provide `--p-sampling-depth 500`, this step will subsample the counts in each sample without replacement so that each sample in the resulting table has a total count of 500.

If you call this command with the `--p-pairwise` parameter, as we’ll do here, it will also perform pairwise tests that will allow you to determine which specific pairs of groups (e.g., human vs dog hosts) differ from one another, if any. This command can be slow to run, especially when passing `--p-pairwise`, since it is based on permutation tests. So, unlike the previous commands, we’ll run this on specific categories of metadata that we’re interested in exploring, rather than all metadata categories that it’s applicable to.
