In most cases the 34-bit files are okay, however if undertaking analysis of large datasets you will need to purchase the 64-bit. The Cryptick lab has the 64-bit versions of usearch8, 9.2 and 10 - you will need to use the iMac to access these. Unfortunately we do not have the 64-bit version on a linux environment and as such cannot run it on the Nimbus cloud. You will have to weight up your options between running the analysis on Nimbus vs iMac. You might consider doing the first steps on the Nimbus cloud and the final steps on the iMac."
